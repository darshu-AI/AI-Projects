# Student Performance Prediction:

## Overview
This project predicts a student’s final exam score using Machine Learning based on academic history and study habits.

## Algorithm Used
- Random Forest Regressor 

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Inputs
- G1 (First internal score)
- G2 (Second internal score)
- Study time
- Absences

## Output
- Predicted final exam score (G3)

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Dataset used for training
- `train_model.py` – Model training script
- `requirements.txt` – Project dependencies

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the model:
python train_model.py

## Note
Trained model files are excluded using `.gitignore` to comply with GitHub file size limits.  
The model can be regenerated by running the training script.
