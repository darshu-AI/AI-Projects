# Student Attention Detection using CNN:

## Overview
This computer vision project classifies a student’s attention state from images as:
- Attentive
- Sleeping

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for image classification.

## Algorithm Used
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV

## Inputs
- Student facial images

## Output
- Attention state classification

## Project Structure
- `models/` – CNN architecture (weights excluded)
- `train_cnn.py` – Model training script
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Train the CNN model:
python train_cnn.py


## Note
Trained model weights are excluded from the repository due to GitHub file size limits.  
They can be regenerated by running the training script.
