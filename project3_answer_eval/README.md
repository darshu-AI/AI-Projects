## Answer Evaluation using Semantic Similarity (NLP)

## Overview  
This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project evaluates a student’s descriptive answer by comparing it with an ideal answer.

The system measures how similar the meanings of both answers are, even if different words are used.

## Algorithm Used  
Sentence Embeddings + Cosine Similarity

## Tech Stack  
Python  
Sentence-Transformers  
Streamlit  

## Inputs  
Question_ID
Student answer (text)

## Output  
Similarity score  
Feedback (Correct / Partially Correct / Needs Improvement)

## Project Structure  
models/ – Pre-trained sentence embedding model (weights excluded)  
app/ – Streamlit user interface  
train_embeddings.py – Generates sentence embeddings  
requirements.txt – Dependencies  

## How to Run  
Install dependencies:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

## Generate embeddings:  
python train_embeddings.py  

## Run the application:  
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py  

## Note  
Pre-trained model files are excluded from the repository due to GitHub file size limits.  
They can be regenerated by running the training script.
